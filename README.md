# BlockChain_ID
**BlockChain_ID** is a decentralized identity management solution built on blockchain technology. It ensures secure, tamper-proof identity verification with user-controlled data privacy and cross-platform authentication, powered by smart contracts. 
Hereâ€™s a sample README file you can use for the **BlockChain_ID** project. Feel free to modify the content according to your specific needs.

   Features

- **Decentralized Identity Management**: Users have full control over their digital identities, eliminating the need for centralized authorities.
- **Immutable Records**: All identity records are stored on a blockchain, ensuring transparency and tamper-proof verification.
- **Privacy by Design**: User data is encrypted and accessible only by authorized parties, protecting sensitive information.
- **Cross-Platform Integration**: Integrates with various applications and platforms for seamless identity verification.
- **Scalable**: Built with a focus on scalability to accommodate growing user bases without sacrificing performance.

## Technologies Used

- **Blockchain**: [Specify the blockchain used, e.g., Ethereum, Hyperledger, etc.]
- **Smart Contracts**: For automated identity verification and record management.
- **Django**: As the backend framework for the web application.
- **React.js**: For building the frontend user interface.
- **IPFS (InterPlanetary File System)**: For decentralized file storage.
- **Python**: For the backend logic and blockchain interaction.
- **Web3.js**: For blockchain interaction in the frontend.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

- You have installed [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) and [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (for frontend dependencies).
- You have installed [Python 3.x](https://www.python.org/) and [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/) (for backend development).
- You have installed [Ganache](https://trufflesuite.com/ganache/) or have access to a blockchain node (e.g., Ethereum).
- You have a basic understanding of blockchain, smart contracts, and web development.

## Installation
